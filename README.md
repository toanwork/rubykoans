# Ruby Koans

This is my attempt to solve the [Ruby Koans](https://www.rubykoans.com/)

Ruby version: 3.2.2

## What I've Learned

- Basic TDD  
\- Red, Green, Refactor  
\- `asert`, `asert_equal` methods *(File: `about_asserts.rb` line 19-34)*  

- Boolean:  
\- `false` and `nil` is treated as `false`  
\- Everything esle is treated as `true`. Example: `0`, `""`, `[]`, `{}`
