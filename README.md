# Ruby Koans

This is my attempt to solve the [Ruby Koans](https://www.rubykoans.com/)

Ruby version: 3.2.2

## What I've Learned

- Basic TDD  
\- Red, Green, Refactor  
\- `asert`, `asert_equal` methods *(File: `about_asserts.rb` line 19-34)*  

- Boolean:  
\- `false` and `nil` is treated as `false`  
\- Everything esle is treated as `true`. Example: `0`, `""`, `[]`, `{}`  

- String:  
\- Create string using single quotes, double quotes, flexible quotes, HERE docs.  
\- Using backslash (`\`) for special characters  *(escape character)*
\- Difference bettween flexible quotes and HERE docs *(File: `about_strings.rb` line 38-56)*  
\- Prefer the shovel operator (`>>`) to the plus equal operator (`+=`) when concatenate strings *(File `about_strings.rb` line 71-105)*  
\- String interpolation: `"After 2 is #{2+1}"`  
\- Double quotes strings support string interpolation and all escape characters *(ie: `\n`)*, single quotes strings don't  
\- How to `split` and `join` strings  
\- Strings are unique objects *(2 variables with the same string value have different object id)*
